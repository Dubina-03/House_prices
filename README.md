Project (House price prediction)
- It's competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). 
- I did Exploratory analys, deal with missing values and outliars, visualize the features, add some new variables (features engineering) and fit regression models. (Linear, Ridge, Lasso and Elasticnet). 
- In result I got 0.13977 (the score is calucalating RMSE), not bad for first project)
