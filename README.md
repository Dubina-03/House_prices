Project (House price prediction)
- It's competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). 
- I did Exploratory analys, deal with missing values and outliars, visualize the features, add some new variables (features engineering) and fit regression models. (Linear, Ridge, Lasso and Elasticnet). The whole project you can see in (https://github.com/Dubina-03/projects/blob/main/house-prices-prediction.ipynb) 
- In result I got 0.13977 (the score is calucalating RMSE), not bad for first project)
